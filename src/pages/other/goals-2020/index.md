It's the end of the year and my original plan for this post was to pat myself on the back and stroke my own ego by talking about how much I acheived this year. When I started this blog I was looking forward to writing this post as I knew I would have loads of stuff to show off and talk about... Unfortunately that is not how things transpired. Reading back on the goals that I set myself for 2019 I can see that I actually acheived a grand total of... none of them. I wish there was good reason for that, however, the truth is that my procrastination and apathy united with work induced burnout and they overpowered my drive and motivation. Basically I was lazy for 9 months and burnt-out from work for the last 3. So only myself to blame really.

On the plus side though, I do have a blog which didn't exist last year. It was something that I had wanted to do for a while so I am happy with myself for getting up and running with around 18 posts. Some of those posts are definitely filler and some are projects that I dropped due to becoming burnt-out towards the end of the year. A large number though are decent posts that I've used to solidify some of my knowledge. My blog has even been praised by some of the people I work with. I've had unprompted comments when a new post has gone before I have told anyone of it. I'm very thankful for those comments as they come from people I respect personally and professionally. Knowing that I have friends reading my blog really makes me want to keep this up.

As for next year, I actually want to continue with many of the same goals as last year. In part that's because of the abject failure of meeting those goals but also because these are my interests and I want to continue to improve in them. I really want to focus this year on completing things that I start. Often last year I would start some grandiose project only to give up due to the size and complexity and I ended up with nothing to show for my efforts. This time my plan is to only work on small projects, pieces and compositions. My hope is that by actually doing things that can be finished in a day, weekend or week that I will have the energy to see the project through and in turn I hope that by completing smaller projects I will see a finished piece that will motivate me to create something else. This will also keep things varied and interesting as well as allowing me to go through any process I have learned multiple times.

With all of that being these are my goals for 2020:

- Continue to improve my development and software engineering skills
- Improve my drawing ability by focusing on drawing fundamentals and figure/portrait drawing
- Continue to learn the piano and create several short compositions
- Learn the fretboard... For realsies this time
- Learn 3D modelling in Blender
- Start writing short stories
- Continue writing blog posts about all of the above
- Meditate

Looking at that list that seems like quite a lot. I wont be too hard on my self if I haven't done everything there (Except for learning the fretboard, there really is no excuse for that). All any of us can do is try, and if we tried our best then there is no reason to feel down about not achieving what we set out to.

Wishing you all the energy and motivation to stay on track with whatever your goals are for the year!
