As mentioned in previous posts creating a game is a long term goal of mine. One of the the things that always discourages me when tinkering and making prototypes is the visuals. I find that using primitive shapes, royalty free asets that dont match each other or asset packs that look great but aren't wuote what they are looking for really puts a downer on the process for me. I'm quite a visual person so if something I'm working doesn't look the way I expect it too it's unmotivating.

With that in mind, and the fact that even if I did use placeholder assets I would still need to create final assets at some point, I have wanted to learn how to use Blender for a while now. At christmas my wife bought me a Udemy course by Gamedev.tv that is present ed by Grant Abitt. Grant Abitt is a bloke I've followed for a while. He is a college level teacher in (3D?) art and does Blender tutorials on the YouTubes. He has a great way of explaining what he's doing and a soothing voice to boot! When i found out he had a Udemy course I had to try it.

The course itself is really well structured. It takes you through the basics of primitive shapes and manipulating them by creating a very basic head and body. It expands on that with some basic hard-surface modelling techniques as well as a section on modular modelling. This is great for creating games as it means assets can be built up from smaller pieces and re-used. The meat of the course for me was the character design section where you are walked through the process of sculpting an ogre. Blocking out, sculpting, refining, texturing and coloring, baking textures and rigging are all covered here and it was all really easy to follow, which is an acomplishment in itself as you'll know if you have ever tried to use Blender before.

I just finised the course this weekend. I really wanted to make sure I completed it as finishing things in one of the themes for me this year. Below are a couple of renders of what I produced while working through this course. One is a mech from the modular assets section and the other is the ogre that was sculpted.

If you are interested in learning Blender then I highly recommend both [Grants YouYube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/mediagabbitt) as well as [his Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/blendercharacters/). The course is a paid course but well worth it at Â£13.99 when it's on offer, which is 90% of the time because Udemy.
