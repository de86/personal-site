Here we are again. The beginning of a new year. Looking back at last years achievements and setting goals for the year ahead.

When I look back at the goals I set for myself for 2020 I only partially achieved a few of them. I started to learn the fretboard, I started to learn piano by working through the Albert books. I started to pick up blender, following tutorials on Youtube by Grant Abitt and currently working through a Udemy course also co-created by Grant Abitt. I also feel like I have definitely grown as a developer too. I moved to a new job at the end of 2019 and have been in a role which has more autonomy and responsibility. I am really enjoying the new job and feel that I have grown into the role well. I've definitely learned a lot and I'm really looking forward to the upcoming year!

As great as all that is I don't really feel like I have achieved too much this year. I'm not particularly good at piano, I haven't made anything in Blender outside of tutorials and i still haven't learned the entire fretboard. I'm not beating myself up about it though. 2020 was a bizarre year for us all for reasons that I wont bother going into because we all already know. This year I have been working in a relatively new job in a new field for me which has also been ridiculously busy. I've gotten married after spending far too long away from my, now, wife and obviously there was the Covid...

So what are my goals for this year? Well essentially the same as last year. The difference is this year I'm not setting myself any hard goals. 2020 was mental and, let's be honest, there is no guarantee that 2021 will be much better. So rather than going into this year with hard goals, I'm going in with a few ideas of what I'd like to work on but with two key ideas. Consistency and finishing things. These are the two main things that have prevented me from getting aything done and so these are the two areas of my life that I plan on improving this year.

So that's it. Hopefully my attempted commitment to consisteny and finishing things will result in something of a revival for this blog. But no promises!

Wishing you all a distinctly boring and average 2021!
