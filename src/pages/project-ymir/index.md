## tldr;

I'm making a procedurally-generated open-world first-person adventure game with dungeon running and looting mechanics. It's far too complex with too large a scope for one person to make. Gonna give it a go anyways. [View the WIP Game Design Doc here](https://www.dantony.uk/project-ymir-game-design-document/).

## Background

For a long time I have tinkered with game dev. It's a challenge I enjoy and I feel that it makes me a better developer. I have made multiple little prototype games with Unity as well as tinkered with Love2D and Phaser and enjoyed it.

It is often stated that to get experience in game dev you should create small games with limited scope in order to actually see a project through to completion. For me though, these small games don't motivate me. They aren't the games I play or want to play. I enjoy the development of the POC but once that challenge is over I no longer have the motivation to put 100s of hours into asset creation, animation, sound effects, polishing etc.

Because of this, I have decided to throw caution to the wind and jump in to a game whose scope and complexity is far too vast and complex for a lone dev to complete. I am going to do it anyway.

## Say hello to Project Ymir

Project [Ymir](https://norse-mythology.org/gods-and-creatures/giants/ymir/) is a first-person adventure game set in a procedurally generated open-world (I know, it's a large task). Think Skyrim exploration in a No Mans Sky generated world with A Zelda like world map and Diablo-esque Dungeon running and Looting (And yes, that's a far too grandiose description and a ridiculously large scope).

I love games that let players to do their own things without pushing them down a corridor and along a strict narrative. I lost hours and hours to Skyrim exploring the map, finding dungeons, taking quests and putting pots on vendors heads.

I love "grinding" for the best loot drops in games(I know I just put off a lot of people there). If the gameplay is good then it isn't a grind. It's simply enjoying the gameplay experience. It becomes a meditation of sorts with the occasional reward of a legendary sword or the crafting item you need to make that piece of armour that allows you to grind in the higher level areas.

I love collecting crafting materials on my quests to come back to town and upgrade my weapons and armour or make that high level weapon that gives you that sensation of being overpowered because you can now one-hit enemies that were killing you left, right and centre at the beginning of the game. (That was a long sentence. Not changing it.)

I really enjoy the Materia system from FF7 and want to implement something similar. I love taking on bounties and hunts in FF Games and Monster Hunter. I loved the gameplay loop of Destiny. Taking on bounties, killing mobs, collecting loot, upgrading weapons and selling them on just to find a new weapon and upgrade that instead. I like the temporay status buffs you get from eating meals in FF15 and Monster Hunter. These are the things I love about my favourite games and these are the things I want my game to have.

## That's far too complex, why would you do this to yourself?

Yes it's far too complex for me to complete alone. The truth is that I don't really expect to finish it. I don't expect it to ever be available on Steam and even if by some miracle I did complete it, I don't expect anyone to actually pay for it let alone actually *enjoy* it.

I'm doing this because this is the game I have always wanted to create. This is the game I thought about when making a Super Crate Box clone or an idle clicker game \**shudder*\*. This is the game that I hope will give me the motivation to keep going even when I get past the initial POC phase. This is the game that *I* want to play.

## Ok, Ok, Where can I track your inevitable failure and descent into madness?

Errr, I'm going to assume that by "inevitable failure and descent into madness" you meant "progress" right? Well I have created a new section on my Blog called Game-Dev.

I plan on posting updates and screenshots there. I will try to post a regular update at least once a month with a summary of progress, though I can't promise any more than that as I am a full-time developer so I tend to go through phases of burnout, especially if I'm going through a busy period at work or need to learn some new technology or something. I also enjoy sports and being active and that's not something I'm willing to give up. This is a passion project but I'm not going to sacrifice my sanity too it.

## One last thing, why Ymir?

Ymir is part of the Norse creation mythology, He was born in the abyss known as Gunnungagap and gave birth to the other giants and gods. His body was used to create the world as we know it. Ymir is the personification of the chaos before creation and can be used as a way of talking about unrealised potential. All in all he seems to perfectly sum up this project for me.

If you got here, thanks for reading. [You can see my WIP Game Design Document here](https://www.dantony.uk/project-ymir-game-design-document/) if you would like to read about the game itself.
