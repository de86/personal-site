## Purpose
There are two main aims of the rules outlined Below.

 1. To make Snooker quicker and more enjoyable for players that aren't very good (Like myself) and to even the game out when playing with someone who is very good (My mate Dave).
 2. To make the game more attacking and to encourage players to go for high breaks by removing the overall score and rewarding high breaks.

## Gameplay
A Smooker match consists of multiple games of Smooker. Points are awarded during these games and the person with the most points at the end of the session wins.

There are several aspects to Smooker that differ from Snooker:

 - The initial break can be decided with a lag
 - Breaks alternate between the players with each game
 - When breaking at least 2 red balls must end up in the other half of the table.
 - The White ball must remain in the reds half of the table
 - When a player commits a foul, the opposing player can take the ball in hand and place it wherever they like on the table
 - When a player is placed in a Snooker, they cannot be made to re-take their shot more than twice
 - Each player has 2 Re-spots (Colour balls placed back on, or as close as possible to, their spots) available to them per game at any time:
	 - A single ball (One nominated) re-spot
	 - A full re-spot (All colours)

## Points
As mentioned earlier players are awarded points for several accomplishments throughout each game

 - 2 points awarded for potting the black
 - 1 point awarded for highest break
 - 1 point awarded for every break over 25

## Set-Up
In Smooker the balls are set-up on the table in the traditional Snooker way with two exceptions:

 - There are 10 red balls used, not 15
 - The pink is not placed on the table until after the player has broke
