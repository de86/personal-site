In a vain attempt to motivate myself to be a productive member of society I have decided to set myself some goals for 2019 (Super original, I know). What I'm hoping to get out of this is a tangible collection of... stuff that I can look back upon at the end of year and feel like I created something, feel like I contributed to the world and didn't just consume chocolate and Chinese food while watching YouTube in my underpants.

 - Make a complete game (Optional: Sell it on a marketplace)
 - Improve my drawing skills and fill two sketchbooks
 - Paint more (Optional: Sell a piece)
 - Write one blog post a week
 - Learn a song a month on my guitar (I won't be torturing you with videos, dont' worry)
 - Learn the notes on the fretboard
- Improve my knowledge of Javascript, programming and software architecture concepts
- Improve my not so 1337 Shell scripting skillz
- Write some short stories
- Meditate

So that's it, they are my goals for the year. If all goes to plan I will have two full sketchbooks, several paintings, a complete game, a better knowledge of programming, a small repertoire of songs to play to myself, in my room where no one will ever hear me and a blog full of my progress  and achievements for the year.

The next 362 days (at the time of writing) will pass wether we create or not, so let's make this a year that we have something to show for and feel proud of at the end.

Here's to a productive 2019!
